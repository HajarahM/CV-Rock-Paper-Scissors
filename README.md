# CV-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Project 1 - Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors
Milestone 1 - Used Teachablemachine.com to create a model for image input of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. The model has classes - Rock, Paper, Scissors and 'Nothing'.  I then downloaded the trained model. This model will be used to get the user input for the game.
